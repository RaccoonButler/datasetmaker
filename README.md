# datasetmaker
A simple JavaScript app that will take an UTAU VoiceBank and a reclist/filelist to create a perfectly balanced dataset. It will cycle through each pitch folder of the voicebank, pulling a wav file from each until the reclist is completed. Users may also control the number of reclist cycles the app goes through.
